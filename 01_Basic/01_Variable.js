/*
    This are the different way of declaring the variable.
    const keyword denote that its value cann't be change.
    var and let value is manipulate.
    var have some problem with scope so we used let to deal with that problem.
    We can also declare variable without using keyword but it is bad practise.
    If we have only declare the varible without assining any value then the value of variable is undefined.
